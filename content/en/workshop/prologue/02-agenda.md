## Lecture video

{{< placeholder date="the next training day" >}}

{{< details  "Module transcript" >}}
So, as I said in the previous segment, I have a roadmap for us to follow:

On the 3rd of April, we will publish the video content for the lecture part on this
website. You will have a window of 10 days to go through the material.

And you can also ask questions about unclear concepts on the dedicated Discord server if
you encounter any. The link to the server is in the top right corner of the website.

---

Please refer to the Help section on the website, which you can access through the left
sidebar, for detailed and up-to-date information.

---

During this period of 10 days, you are also encouraged to go through some pre-flight
checks, in preparation for an optimal experience throughout the hands on sessions,
which will take place on the 13th of the same month.

You will find more details under the "hands-on sessions" menu on the left sidebar.

---

In those sessions, we will be solving a set of small exercises to practice
what we learned and we will conclude with a tiny project where we try to make
serial code work in parallel settings.

---

For the lecture part, we will go through the most important concepts around parallel
programming in OpenFOAM; starting with a general introduction where the basic
concepts are introduced

Then moving on to the core chapters which focus on
exploring how point-to-point and collective communications can be used through
OpenFOAM mechanisms.

---

We also take a look at how users are supposed to communicate their own data types
and then, at the end of the lecture part, we will check some interesting
application examples and advanced topics around parallel computing in OpenFOAM.
